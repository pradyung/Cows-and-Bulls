# Cows-and-Bulls
A simple Cows and Bulls game made with Unity.

## Game
The game can be played on Unity Play at [https://play.unity.com/mg/other/cows-and-bulls](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/cows-and-bulls)

Cows and Bulls is a guessing game similar to Wordle, but with a 4 digit number instead of a 5 letter word. In this version, a player plays against a computer, which generates a random number. The number does not have duplicate digits and does not start with a 0. Each guess is rated in terms of cows and bulls. A cow means that one digit in the guess is in the answer, but it is not in the right place. A bull is the same thing, except the digit IS in the right place. The game ends when the player guesses the number correctly.
